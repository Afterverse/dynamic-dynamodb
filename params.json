This project is under active development and will be released to master (i.e. a stable version within the near future).\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis example will configure Dynamic DynamoDB to:\r\n\r\n- Scale up your DynamoDB table when the consumed reads 90% of the total provisioned reads\r\n- Scale up your DynamoDB table when the consumed writes 90% of the total provisioned writes\r\n- Scale up your reads with 50%\r\n- Scale up your writes with 40%\r\n- Scale down your DynamoDB table when the consumed reads 30% of the total provisioned reads\r\n- Scale down your DynamoDB table when the consumed writes 40% of the total provisioned writes\r\n- Scale down your reads with 40%\r\n- Scale down your writes with 70%\r\n- Check for changes every 5 minutes\r\n\r\nCommand:\r\n\r\n    dynamic-dynamodb --table-name my-table \\\r\n                     --reads-upper-threshold 90 \\\r\n                     --reads-lower-threshold 30 \\\r\n                     --increase-reads-with 50 \\\r\n                     --decrease-reads-with 40 \\\r\n                     --writes-upper-threshold 90 \\\r\n                     --writes-lower-threshold 40 \\\r\n                     --increase-writes-with 40 \\\r\n                     --decrease-writes-with 70 \\\r\n                     --check-interval 300\r\n\r\nFull --help output\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n    usage: dynamic-dynamodb [-h] [--dry-run] [--check-interval CHECK_INTERVAL]\r\n                            [-r REGION] -t TABLE_NAME\r\n                            [--reads-upper-threshold READS_UPPER_THRESHOLD]\r\n                            [--reads-lower-threshold READS_LOWER_THRESHOLD]\r\n                            [--increase-reads-with INCREASE_READS_WITH]\r\n                            [--decrease-reads-with DECREASE_READS_WITH]\r\n                            [--writes-upper-threshold WRITES_UPPER_THRESHOLD]\r\n                            [--writes-lower-threshold WRITES_LOWER_THRESHOLD]\r\n                            [--increase-writes-with INCREASE_WRITES_WITH]\r\n                            [--decrease-writes-with DECREASE_WRITES_WITH]\r\n\r\n    Dynamic DynamoDB - Auto provisioning AWS DynamoDB\r\n\r\n    optional arguments:\r\n      -h, --help            show this help message and exit\r\n      --dry-run             Run without making any changes to your DynamoDB\r\n                            database\r\n      --check-interval CHECK_INTERVAL\r\n                            How many seconds should we wait between the checks\r\n                            (default: 300)\r\n\r\n    DynamoDB settings:\r\n      -r REGION, --region REGION\r\n                            AWS region to operate in\r\n      -t TABLE_NAME, --table-name TABLE_NAME\r\n                            How many percent should we decrease the read units\r\n                            with?\r\n\r\n    Read units scaling properties:\r\n      --reads-upper-threshold READS_UPPER_THRESHOLD\r\n                            Scale up the reads with --increase-reads-with percent\r\n                            if the currently consumed read units reaches this many\r\n                            percent (default: 90)\r\n      --reads-lower-threshold READS_LOWER_THRESHOLD\r\n                            Scale down the reads with --decrease-reads-with\r\n                            percent if the currently consumed read units is as low\r\n                            as this percentage (default: 30)\r\n      --increase-reads-with INCREASE_READS_WITH\r\n                            How many percent should we increase the read units\r\n                            with?

You can file bugs in the project's [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/sebdah/dynamic-dynamodb/issues).\r\n\r\nProvide as much details as possible to make bug fixing as swift as possible.\r\n\r\nGit strategy\r\n------------\r\n\r\nThis project uses [git-flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) for handling branching and releasing in Git. See the following [blog post](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) for more details on how it works.\r\n\r\nRelease information\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\n**0.1.4 (2013-03-24)**\r\n- Initial release\r\n\r\nReleasing to PyPI\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n    make release\r\n\r\nAuthor\r\n------\r\n\r\nThis project is maintained by [Sebastian Dahlgren](http://www.sebastiandahlgren.se) ([GitHub](https://github.com/sebdah) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sebdah) | [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/sebastiandahlgren))\r\n","google":"UA-37516009-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
