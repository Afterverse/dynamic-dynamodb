{"name":"Dynamic-dynamodb","tagline":"Auto-provisioning tool for DynamoDB","body":"Dynamic DynamoDB\r\n================\r\n\r\nAWS hosted NoSQL solution DynamoDB is a great service, but it falls short when it comes to automatic scaling. This is where Dynamic DynamoDB enters the stage. It provides automatic read and write provisioning for DynamoDB.\r\n\r\nAll you need to do is to tell Dynamic DynamoDB at which point and how much you want to scale up or down your DynamoDB. For example, if the consumed read capacity reaches 90%, it might be a good idea to scale up the read provisioning slightly to meet the flood of requests to your service.\r\n\r\nSee an example of how to configure Dynamic DynamoDB under **Basic usage** or checkout `dynamic-dynamodb --help`.\r\n\r\nBasic usage\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nThis example will configure Dynamic DynamoDB to:\r\n\r\n- Scale up your DynamoDB table when the consumed reads 90% of the total provisioned reads\r\n- Scale up your DynamoDB table when the consumed writes 90% of the total provisioned writes\r\n- Scale up your reads with 50%\r\n- Scale up your writes with 40%\r\n- Scale down your DynamoDB table when the consumed reads 30% of the total provisioned reads\r\n- Scale down your DynamoDB table when the consumed writes 40% of the total provisioned writes\r\n- Scale down your reads with 40%\r\n- Scale down your writes with 70%\r\n- Check for changes every 5 minutes\r\n\r\nCommand:\r\n\r\n    dynamic-dynamodb --table-name my-table \\\r\n                     --reads-upper-threshold 90 \\\r\n                     --reads-lower-threshold 30 \\\r\n                     --increase-reads-with 50 \\\r\n                     --decrease-reads-with 40 \\\r\n                     --writes-upper-threshold 90 \\\r\n                     --writes-lower-threshold 40 \\\r\n                     --increase-writes-with 40 \\\r\n                     --decrease-writes-with 70 \\\r\n                     --check-interval 300\r\n\r\nInstallation instructions\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to install Dynamic DynamoDB is through PyPI:\r\n\r\n    pip install dynamic-dynamodb\r\n\r\nFull --help output\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n    usage: dynamic-dynamodb [-h] [--dry-run] [--check-interval CHECK_INTERVAL]\r\n                            [-r REGION] -t TABLE_NAME\r\n                            [--reads-upper-threshold READS_UPPER_THRESHOLD]\r\n                            [--reads-lower-threshold READS_LOWER_THRESHOLD]\r\n                            [--increase-reads-with INCREASE_READS_WITH]\r\n                            [--decrease-reads-with DECREASE_READS_WITH]\r\n                            [--min-provisioned-reads MIN_PROVISIONED_READS]\r\n                            [--max-provisioned-reads MAX_PROVISIONED_READS]\r\n                            [--writes-upper-threshold WRITES_UPPER_THRESHOLD]\r\n                            [--writes-lower-threshold WRITES_LOWER_THRESHOLD]\r\n                            [--increase-writes-with INCREASE_WRITES_WITH]\r\n                            [--decrease-writes-with DECREASE_WRITES_WITH]\r\n                            [--min-provisioned-writes MIN_PROVISIONED_WRITES]\r\n                            [--max-provisioned-writes MAX_PROVISIONED_WRITES]\r\n\r\n    Dynamic DynamoDB - Auto provisioning AWS DynamoDB\r\n\r\n    optional arguments:\r\n      -h, --help            show this help message and exit\r\n      --dry-run             Run without making any changes to your DynamoDB\r\n                            database\r\n      --check-interval CHECK_INTERVAL\r\n                            How many seconds should we wait between the checks\r\n                            (default: 300)\r\n\r\n    DynamoDB settings:\r\n      -r REGION, --region REGION\r\n                            AWS region to operate in\r\n      -t TABLE_NAME, --table-name TABLE_NAME\r\n                            How many percent should we decrease the read units\r\n                            with?\r\n\r\n    Read units scaling properties:\r\n      --reads-upper-threshold READS_UPPER_THRESHOLD\r\n                            Scale up the reads with --increase-reads-with percent\r\n                            if the currently consumed read units reaches this many\r\n                            percent (default: 90)\r\n      --reads-lower-threshold READS_LOWER_THRESHOLD\r\n                            Scale down the reads with --decrease-reads-with\r\n                            percent if the currently consumed read units is as low\r\n                            as this percentage (default: 30)\r\n      --increase-reads-with INCREASE_READS_WITH\r\n                            How many percent should we increase the read units\r\n                            with?
