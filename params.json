{"name":"Dynamic DynamoDB","tagline":"Auto-provisioning tool for DynamoDB","body":"Dynamic DynamoDB\r\n================\r\n\r\nAWS DynamoDB is a great service, but it falls short when it comes to automated throughput scaling. This is where Dynamic DynamoDB enters the stage. It provides automatic read and write provisioning for DynamoDB.\r\n\r\nAll you need to do is to tell Dynamic DynamoDB at which point and how much you want to scale up or down your DynamoDB. An example is in place. Letâ€™s say you have way more traffic on your database during sales hours 4pm - 10pm. DynamicDB can monitor the increased throughput on your DynamoDB instance (via CloudWatch) and provision more throughput as needed. When the load is reducing Dynamic DynamoDB will sence that and automatically reduce your provisioning.\r\n\r\nSee an example of how to configure Dynamic DynamoDB under **Basic usage** or checkout `dynamic-dynamodb --help`.\r\n\r\nFeatures in short\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n- Scale up and down DynamoDB automatically\r\n- Restrict scaling to certain time slots\r\n- Gives you control over how much reads and writes you want to scale up and down with\r\n- Dynamic DynamoDB has support for max and min limits so that you always knows how much money you spend at most and how much capacity you can be guaranteed\r\n\r\nBasic usage\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nThis example will configure Dynamic DynamoDB to:\r\n\r\n- Scale up your DynamoDB table when the consumed reads 90% of the total provisioned reads\r\n- Scale up your DynamoDB table when the consumed writes 90% of the total provisioned writes\r\n- Scale up your reads with 50%\r\n- Scale up your writes with 40%\r\n- Scale down your DynamoDB table when the consumed reads 30% of the total provisioned reads\r\n- Scale down your DynamoDB table when the consumed writes 40% of the total provisioned writes\r\n- Scale down your reads with 40%\r\n- Scale down your writes with 70%\r\n- Check for changes every 5 minutes\r\n\r\nCommand:\r\n\r\n    dynamic-dynamodb --table-name my-table \\\r\n                     --reads-upper-threshold 90 \\\r\n                     --reads-lower-threshold 30 \\\r\n                     --increase-reads-with 50 \\\r\n                     --decrease-reads-with 40 \\\r\n                     --writes-upper-threshold 90 \\\r\n                     --writes-lower-threshold 40 \\\r\n                     --increase-writes-with 40 \\\r\n                     --decrease-writes-with 70 \\\r\n                     --check-interval 300\r\n\r\nInstallation instructions\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to install Dynamic DynamoDB is through PyPI:\r\n\r\n    pip install dynamic-dynamodb\r\n\r\nExample configuration file\r\n--------------------------\r\n\r\n    [global]\r\n    # AWS access keys\r\n    #aws-access-key-id: AWS_ACCESS_KEY\r\n    #aws-secret-access-key-id: AWS_SECRET_KEY\r\n\r\n    # AWS region to use\r\n    region: us-east-1\r\n\r\n    # How often should Dynamic DynamoDB monitor changes (in seconds)\r\n    check-interval: 300\r\n\r\n    [table: my_table]\r\n    #\r\n    # Read provisioning configuration\r\n    #\r\n\r\n    # Thresholds for scaling up or down the provisioning (%)\r\n    reads-upper-threshold: 90\r\n    reads-lower-threshold: 30\r\n\r\n    # How many percent should Dynamic DynamoDB increase/decrease provisioning with (%)\r\n    increase-reads-with: 50\r\n    decrease-reads-with: 50\r\n\r\n    # Maximum and minimum read provisioning\r\n    # Dynamic DynamoDB will not provision any more or less reads than this\r\n    #min-provisioned-reads: 100\r\n    #max-provisioned-reads: 500\r\n\r\n    #\r\n    # Write provisioning configuration\r\n    #\r\n\r\n    # Thresholds for scaling up or down the provisioning (%)\r\n    writes-upper-threshold: 90\r\n    writes-lower-threshold: 30\r\n\r\n    # How many percent should Dynamic DynamoDB increase/decrease provisioning with (%)\r\n    increase-writes-with: 50\r\n    decrease-writes-with: 50\r\n\r\n    # Maximum and minimum write provisioning\r\n    # Dynamic DynamoDB will not provision any more or less writes than this\r\n    #min-provisioned-writes: 100\r\n    #max-provisioned-writes: 500\r\n\r\n    #\r\n    # Maintenance windows (in UTC)\r\n    #\r\n    maintenance-windows: 22:00-23:59,00:00-06:00\r\n\r\nFull --help output\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n    usage: dynamic_dynamodb [-h] [--dry-run] [--check-interval CHECK_INTERVAL]\r\n                            [--aws-access-key-id AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID]\r\n                            [--aws-secret-access-key AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY]\r\n                            [-r REGION] -t TABLE_NAME\r\n                            [--reads-upper-threshold READS_UPPER_THRESHOLD]\r\n                            [--reads-lower-threshold READS_LOWER_THRESHOLD]\r\n                            [--increase-reads-with INCREASE_READS_WITH]\r\n                            [--decrease-reads-with DECREASE_READS_WITH]\r\n                            [--min-provisioned-reads MIN_PROVISIONED_READS]\r\n                            [--max-provisioned-reads MAX_PROVISIONED_READS]\r\n                            [--writes-upper-threshold WRITES_UPPER_THRESHOLD]\r\n                            [--writes-lower-threshold WRITES_LOWER_THRESHOLD]\r\n                            [--increase-writes-with INCREASE_WRITES_WITH]\r\n                            [--decrease-writes-with DECREASE_WRITES_WITH]\r\n                            [--min-provisioned-writes MIN_PROVISIONED_WRITES]\r\n                            [--max-provisioned-writes MAX_PROVISIONED_WRITES]\r\n\r\n    Dynamic DynamoDB -
